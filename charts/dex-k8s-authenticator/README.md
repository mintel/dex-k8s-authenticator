# Helm chart for dex-k8s-authenticator

This chart installs [`dex-k8s-authenticator`](https://github.com/mintel/dex-k8s-authenticator) in a Kubernetes cluster. 
`dex-k8s-authenticator` is a helper application for [`dex`](https://github.com/coreos/dex). `dex` lets you use external 
Identify Providers (like Google, Microsoft, GitHUb, LDAP) to authenticate access to Kubernetes cluster
(e.g. for `kubectl`). This helper makes it easy to provide a web UI for one or more clusters.
It give uses the information and commands to configure `kubectl` to work with the credentials `dex` provides.

You can configure one or more clusters in this chart configuration, for the one or more `dex` installs you may have.

### Adding Trusted Certs

Multiple trusted certs can be added using the `caCerts` option. Make sure to `base64` encode each CA.

### Service Requests on SSL

Define the filepath to your cert and key using the following options in your helm chart.
  - `dexK8sAuthenticator.tlsCert`
  - `dexK8sAuthenticator.tlsKey`

TODO: Requires more work as we don't have a way deploy self-signed certs or change to https scheme.
