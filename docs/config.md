## Environment Variable Support

Environment variables can be included in the configuration. This enables you to pass in dynamic variables or secrets without having to hardcode them.
```
clusters:
  - name: example-cluster
    short_description: "Example Cluster"
    description: "Example Cluster Long Description..."
    client_secret: ${CLIENT_SECRET_EXAMPLE_CLUSTER}
```

In this example, `${CLIENT_SECRET_EXAMPLE_CLUSTER}` is substituted at runtime. Must be enclosed by `${...}`

## Web Path Prefix

A common practise is configure `dex-k8s-authenticator` to serve requests under a specific path prefix, such as `https://mycompany.example.com/dex-auth`

You can achieve this by configuring the `web_path_prefix`. In most cases you will need to adjust the Ingress `path` setting to match.

In addition to this, you need to update the `redirect_uri` value.

```yaml
clusters:
  - name: example-cluster
    short_description: "Example Cluster"
    description: "Example Cluster Long Description..."
    redirect_uri: http://127.0.0.1:5555/dex-auth/callback/example-cluster
    client_secret: ...
    client_id: example-cluster-client-id
    issuer:  http://127.0.0.1:5556
    k8s_master_uri: https://your-k8s-master.cluster
    scopes: 
      - email
      - profile
      - openid
    group: dev

# A path-prefix from which to serve requests and assets
web_path_prefix: /dex-auth
```

Don't forget to update the Dex `staticClients.redirectURIs` value to include the prefix as well.

### Helm

The `dex-k8s-authenticator` helm charts support this via the `dexK8sAuthenticator.web_path_prefix` and `ingress.path` options. You typically set these to the same value.

Note that the health-checks are configured automatically.
